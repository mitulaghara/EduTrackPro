# EduTrack

EduTrack is a lightweight front-end project that provides a simple structure for presenting course material, notes, or small learning modules in a browser. It uses plain HTML, CSS and JavaScript and is intended as a starter template for educational pages.

Live demo: https://mitulaghara.github.io/EduTrackPro/

## Purpose
- Provide a minimal, easy-to-customize client-side project to showcase teaching content, practice exercises, or small interactive lessons.

## Features
- Simple file-based structure (`index.html`, `css/style.css`, `js/script.js`).
- Easy to edit and extend for custom content and interactions.

## Project structure
```
`index.html`        # Main page
`css/style.css`     # Styles
`js/script.js`      # Client-side logic
```

## Quick start
1. Download or clone the repository and open `index.html` in your browser — no server needed.

Optional: Run a local HTTP server (recommended for some browser features):
```
# macOS / Linux (Python 3):
python3 -m http.server 8000

# Then open: http://localhost:8000
```

## Deploy / GitHub
This project is live at the demo URL above. To deploy/update on GitHub Pages, push your code to the repository `EduTrackPro` on GitHub (owner: `mitulaghara`) and enable GitHub Pages in the repo settings, or push to a `gh-pages` branch.
